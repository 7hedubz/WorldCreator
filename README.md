# WorldCreator
Welcome to my first public project for Python. This work was spawned of a need for a particular type of world-building program and is intended to be used as a reference tool/creativity tool before, during and after games of D&D. While designed with D&D in mind I left it "fairly" open ended as to how you'd like to create your world. 

This project utilizes PySide2 for it's GUI. The command line commandusing pip to install this package on Windows (The machine I use) is as follows.

pip install PySide2

Troubleshooting can be found here - https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/

While I'm fairly certain in it's current state it's workable.

As for a few acknowledgements;
My older brother ChaoticSeven who got me into DMing and when he heard about this tool he pushed me and pushed me into finishing it, or at least getting it to somewhere he could play around with it. 
My good friend Hill, he likes hills. He likes climbing and then claiming hills as his own, and he hates radios. Regardless, I got him into D&D and now he can't get enough of it. He heard about this tool and unendingly gives me new features to add into it. He has no idea what goes into all of this, but his idea's are great nonetheless.
